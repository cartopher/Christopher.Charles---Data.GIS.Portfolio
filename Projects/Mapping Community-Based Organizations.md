****Description:
In my capacity at Bay Park Data Solutions, I successfully designed and implemented a web mapping application for the "Alliance For Girls - Los Angeles." This innovative tool serves a pivotal role in visualizing a heat map of community-based organizations and nonprofits dedicated to serving girls and gender-expansive youth within Service Planning Areas (SPA) 6 and 7. The primary goal of this project was to enhance outreach efforts, ensuring that services reach those most in need effectively and efficiently.

The web mapping application was meticulously crafted using the Esri ArcGIS Suite, integrating core GIS tools such as ArcGIS Online and leveraging web and app development capabilities through Experience Builder. My expertise in Python and JavaScript played a crucial role in automating data processing tasks and enriching the application with interactive features that provide users with an intuitive and informative experience.

By incorporating a user-friendly interface designed with a focus on UI/UX principles, the application facilitates easy navigation and interpretation of data, allowing stakeholders to identify areas of high need and the locations of service providers. This strategic visualization tool employs heat mapping techniques to highlight regions with a dense concentration of organizations supporting girls and gender-expansive youth, thus pinpointing where outreach efforts can be maximized for the greatest impact.

This project underscores my commitment to leveraging GIS for social good, embodying my core values of innovation, efficiency, and responsiveness to community needs. It showcases my ability to manage complex data sets, transforming them into actionable insights through sophisticated geospatial visualization techniques. Furthermore, the project highlights my adeptness in cross-functional collaboration, client-centric design, and the application of agile methodologies to meet project objectives within dynamic and challenging environments.

Overall, the "Alliance For Girls - Los Angeles" web mapping application stands as a testament to my expertise in GIS, my dedication to creating tools that serve vital community outreach objectives, and my unwavering commitment to contributing positively to societal advancements through technological innovation.
