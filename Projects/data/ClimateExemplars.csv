Inspired by a woman who gave her a scholarship to college with the instruction to “pass on the kindness,” she founded the Othakarhaka (“Passing on the Kindness”) Charity Foundation in 2012 to transform poor struggling villages into self-reliant, sustainable communities. The Foundation’s 6,000+ volunteers support programs in girls and women’s empowerment, health, education, sustainable agriculture and agroforestry, social welfare for the elderly, and care for orphans. Thanks to her work, new agricultural approaches have more than quadrupled the production of maize for many elderly people. She also funds dozens of girls and boys to attend secondary school. Ida draws her strength and vision from her Pentecostal church and daily prayer, quoting Psalm 121: “My help comes from the Lord, the creator of the universe.

At 67, Mason brings a wealth of experience from various sectors — from the entertainment industry to organic food movements, and from meditation and spiritual teaching to entrepreneurship and activism. Her early ventures in pioneering organic food delivery and the introduction of organic sections in supermarkets, in collaboration with Woody Harrelson, were precursors to her broader environmental advocacy. Mason's work has always been intertwined with her spiritual practice, influencing her approach to creating systemic change and fostering community resilience. Moving into the realm of supporting Black entrepreneurs, Mason's focus has been on leveling the economic playing field and ensuring that Black farmers can retain their land — a critical aspect of environmental justice and climate resilience. Her efforts in starting nonprofits and a loan fund specifically aimed at this demographic have worked towards correcting historical inequities in land ownership and access to resources. Transplanting her life from Oakland to Alexandria, Louisiana, Mason's daily practice of hands-on agricultural work coupled with meditation embodies her mantra of uplifting ""race, land, and spirit"" while challenging the cultural dominance of money. Her work at the Spirit Rock Meditation Center, where she added a diversity component, showcases her dedication to inclusivity within spiritual practices. Mason's current endeavors in Louisiana are a direct application of her lifelong values — promoting sustainable agriculture as a means to nurture the environment, support local communities, and provide a space for spiritual reflection and growth. Her emphasis on the interconnectedness of race, land, and spirit in her fight against climate change positions her as a unique and powerful voice within the climate resilience movement. Through her multifaceted approach, Mason inspires a holistic vision of what it means to live sustainably and equitably, with a mindfulness that challenges and redefines conventional priorities in society.","A longtime Buddhist, Konda Mason has worn many hats in her 67 years.
