Gary was a member of a working party on sectarianism in the early 1990’s drawn together by the Irish Council of Churches, which resulted in the publication “Sectarianism”. This was the most detailed report ever made to the Irish church on this topic. The co-chair of this working party was Mary MacAleese, the former President of Ireland.","Gary Mason, a Methodist Minister, spent 28 years as a clergy person in Belfast and was involved in the Northern Irish Peace Process. Two Protestant loyalist paramilitary groups announced the decommissioning of their weapons in Mason’s church. Mason also led faith-based redevelopment organizations and created a mixed Protestant-Catholic community that continues today. In 2015, Mason founded Rethinking Conﬂict to bring what he learned while working on the Irish Peace Process to others in Ireland and beyond. He has spoken to more than 60,000 people in recent years. He remains motivated by seeing people’s lives turn around, as well as the thought that he could have ended up as a com- batant rather than a peacemaker.",https://www.rethinkingconflict.com,,https://crcc.usc.edu/rev-gary-mason-faith-on-the-peace-lines-of-northern-ireland/,https://uscssi.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/f6bf1a4200544f60a514afae498a8131/data,Brie Loskota,44507,Brie Loskota,https://uscssi.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/287852485d164531bcf9bf77e353d9ec/data,https://uscssi.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/aa04627ef026410dace9370788ba0fe6/data,Gary Mason

They are a founder of the California Grain Campaign, an initiative aimed at helping small-scale farmers build a market for diverse grains. They also founded and manage an influential heirloom grain farm, which produces heritage grains using organic, drought-tolerant and soil-enriching methods. Nguyen opts for human and animal power over tractors, synthetic fertilizer and pesticides, and sees grain farming as a vehicle for social and environmental activism. They are also the co-Director at Minnow, an organization that secures farmland tenure for California’s farmers of color while advancing indigenous sovereignty.

Grain, Nguyen believes, can play an important role in mitigating the oncoming effects of climate change. It can help rehabilitate land and reduce carbon emissions, while also making the land productive. The Buddhist principle of interconnectedness drives Nguyen’s belief that how they treat a plot of land in California has a direct impact on the larger community: animals, people, plants and air. 

In 2016, Nguyen formed the California Grain Campaign, an initiative aimed at helping small-scale farmers build a market for diverse grains. Years later, she leased a plot of land near Sebastopol that’s since become an influential heirloom grain farm. There, Nguyen specializes in growing heritage grains from Vietnam, Syria and Afghanistan, using organic, drought-tolerant and soil-enriching methods (important given California’s drought). Nguyen opts for human and animal power over tractors, synthetic fertilizer and pesticides. They are also the co-Director at Minnow, an organization that secures farmland tenure for California’s farmers of color while advancing indigenous sovereignty.

Nguyen’s farm is one of few grain farms in Wine Country, where agricultural land is expensive. That’s part of what makes Nguyen’s farm so impactful — they’re showing that this dietary staple can be farmed with just as much care as bigger-cash crops. Nguyen sees grain farming as a vehicle for social and environmental activism. Grain, Nguyen believes, could play an important role in mitigating the oncoming effects of climate change. It can help rehabilitate land and reduce carbon emissions, while also making the land productive. 

The Buddhist principle of interconnectedness drives Nguyen’s belief that how they treat a plot of land in California has a direct impact on the larger community: animals, people, plants and air. “My Vietnamese and Buddhist upbringing taught me about interconnectedness and how we need to be concerned not only about our consumption, but about how we’re connected to everything in the world’s ecosystem,” Mai says. “I feel that as a farmer I have a responsibility to the other parts of our planet’s ecosystem.”

Nguyen grew up spiritually connected to the vegetables their grandmother grew in her Southern California backyard: rau rum, chile peppers and bitter melon. Those foods, Nguyen says, kept them connected to their roots. The family regularly brought the vegetables as offerings to their buddhist temples, and each night, they sat down at dinner and said a prayer for the farmers and the food they produced. “For me,” Nguyen said, “farming is a way to contribute to this effort of keeping our present in contact with our past and keeping us in touch with each other.”

In the past 6 years, Nguyen’s farm has become California’s most noteworthy grain farm, growing what the SF Chronicle calls “a coveted insider’s secret among top bakers and a favorite of breweries and distilleries.” Their flour has become a base for esteemed bakers like Roxana Julapat of Friends and Family in Los Angeles and Crystal White of San Diego’s Wayfarer Bread. Local breweries and distilleries have jumped at the chance to buy Nguyen’s rye.

Still, farming can be heartbreaking, Nguyen says. They treat the land with intense care and love. And sometimes, they have to walk away from it. “That’s when I tap into my Buddhist upbringing, and I remember that I’ve now left it better for someone else.”

For more than 25 years, Barankitse, a Burundian Roman Catholic, has led Maison Shalom, or House of Peace, the holistic humanitarian organization she established to generate hope for the next generation in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Maison Shalom was born from tragedy. When ethnic violence exploded in Burundi in October 1993, Barankitse, who is Tutsi, attempted to protect Hutu neighbors and colleagues. Tutsi militia members took her captive and forced her to watch 72 executions before ultimately letting her go. As the conflict continued, Barankitse set up Maison Shalom to shelter orphan children from both tribes. When children from many backgrounds sought refuge at Maison Shalom, Barankitse expanded her efforts to include education, healthcare, microenterprise and psychological counseling. In 2015, political tensions escalated across Burundi, and Barankitse spoke out against the government’s violent crackdown on protestors. She was placed on a death list, and all Maison Shalom work in Burundi was shut down. Barankitse fled to Europe, but says God called her to continue her work. She moved to Rwanda where she re-launched Maison Shalom to provide Burundian refugees, especially young people, with social, educational, economic and psychological support. Barankitse is a vigorous advocate for forgiveness and reconciliation because without them, she says, the region “has no future.”","Marguerite (Maggy) Barankitse has witnessed horriﬁc acts of genocide, political violence and social injustice, yet she is unwav- ering in her belief that evil will not ultimately prevail.

She grew up poor, completed college and graduate school, has a great job at a Christian university — North Park Theological Seminary in Chicago  — and a cabin in the Michigan woods. As many evangelical Christians would, she thanks Jesus for her good fortune. But when Michelle searches the Bible, she doesn’t go straight to the Jesus parts for inspiration. She says she finds it in the Scripture’s stories of failure: King David’s, for example, or Adam and Eve’s failure in the Garden of Eden. She believes “that the whole story is one of healing, restoration, reconciliation, redemption, and when you put those two things together, you have the safety to then to fail yourself and know you’re going to be picked up.” With biblical stories of failure on her mind, Michelle did something a few years ago that no one at her seminary — or in her state — had done. She took those stories straight to men in a place that symbolizes their failure and society’s: Stateville Correctional Center. Michelle started Illinois’ first master’s degree program inside a maximum security prison.   “Definitely when we first went in,” Michelle says, “a lot of them were like, ‘What is this white woman doing in here? What does she want?’ ” She wants the men inside Stateville to get an education. She wants some of those men to get out. And she wants to abolish — or at least profoundly reform —  an American prison system she sees as deeply unjust.

They view their role as supporting people who are crossing the border to “self-rescue” themselves and help one another make it through the desert. The remains of more than 3000 migrants have been recovered in Southern Arizona in the last two decades –- as of May 2020, Scott had participated in 23 of those recoveries. Scott and Emily are volunteers with Ajo Samaritans and No More Deaths, both groups are interfaith, non-hierarchical organizations. Neither Scott or Emily identify with an organized religion, but their spirituality is part of what guides them to volunteer to try and prevent more deaths and recover the remains of those who have died. Recently the legality of certain kinds of border humanitarian aid was tested in federal court when federal authorities cracked down on volunteers in 2018. Scott was among a group of nine No More Deaths volunteers charged with misdemeanors for driving on a restricted road without a permit and leaving water in a federal wildlife refuge. Then, two Central American migrants, José Arnaldo Sacaria-Goday and Kristian Perez-Villanueva, arrived at a house volunteers use in Ajo. Warren shared food and water with the men, and gave them first aid and a place to sleep. Border Patrol agents were surveilling the house and arrested all three men. Warren was charged with harboring and conspiracy felonies. After two trials, a federal jury acquitted Scott for the felony charges in November 2019. In his misdemeanor trial, Warren used a “religious freedom” defense under the Religions Freedom Restoration Act to justify driving on a restricted road and leaving water in the wildlife refuge. It was the first time a humanitarian aid activist accused of breaking federal law had invoked a religious freedom defense. A federal judge sided with him on one charge. Federal prosecutors wound up dropping the second charge. Next, a second federal judge reversed the convictions of four other No More Death volunteers who had also used a religious freedom defense. Border volunteers say they now feel there is more legal certainty that the aid they provide is a protected expression of their spirituality.","Scott Warren and Emily Saunders are part of a network of more than 200 humanitarian aid volunteers who leave jugs of water and easy-open-cans of beans in the desert in an eﬀort to reduce the number of migrants and asylum seekers who die on their journey crossing the border.
