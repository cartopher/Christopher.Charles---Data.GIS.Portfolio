## 5. Versioning
- **Version Control**: Managing changes to documents, programs, and datasets by creating multiple versions to track and reconcile modifications.
- **Geodatabase Versioning**: A feature that allows multiple users to edit GIS data simultaneously by creating different versions of the dataset.
- **Parent Version**: The original version of the data from which other versions are derived.
- **Child Version**: A version created from the parent version that allows for independent edits.
- **Reconcile**: The process of merging changes from a child version back into the parent version.
- **Post**: Applying reconciled changes from a child version to the parent version in the geodatabase.
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifying discrepancies between different versions of data during the reconcile process.

## 6. Editing Rules
- **Attribute Rules**: Constraints or calculations applied to attribute fields in a geodatabase to enforce data integrity and automate updates.
- **Subtype**: A classification within a feature class that defines different rules or behaviors for different types of features.
- **Domain**: A set of valid values for an attribute, ensuring data consistency.
- **Topology Rules**: Rules that define spatial relationships between features, such as ensuring that lines connect at endpoints or that polygons do not overlap.
- **Validation**: The process of checking data against defined rules to ensure it meets quality and integrity standards.
- **Contingent Values**: Dependencies between fields that enforce certain combinations of values in related attributes.

## 7. Database Relationships
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a database table, ensuring each record can be uniquely identified.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in a database table that creates a link between two tables by referring to the primary key in another table.
- **One-to-One Relationship**: A relationship where each record in one table is linked to a single record in another table.
- **One-to-Many Relationship**: A relationship where each record in one table can be linked to multiple records in another table.
- **Many-to-Many Relationship**: A relationship where multiple records in one table can be linked to multiple records in another table, often implemented using a junction table.
- **Join**: Combining fields from two tables based on a related column between them to create a unified dataset.
- **Relate**: A temporary association between two tables based on a common attribute, allowing combined querying without permanently altering the database schema.
