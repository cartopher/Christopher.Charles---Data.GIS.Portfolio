       - **Weighted Overlay**: Use the Weighted Overlay tool to combine different criteria layers and generate a suitability map.
         ```plaintext
         Analysis Tab > Tools > Weighted Overlay > Set parameters and run the analysis
         ```
       - **Results**: Identify the most suitable areas for new parks based on the combined criteria.

### 5. **Visualizing and Interpreting Results**
   - **Map Creation**: Create maps to visualize the analysis results.
     ```plaintext
     Insert Tab > New Map > Add Analysis Results
     ```
   - **Symbology**: Use appropriate symbology to highlight key findings and ensure the map is clear and informative.
     ```plaintext
     Symbology Pane > Adjust colors, styles, and labels
     ```
   - **Charts and Graphs**: Generate charts and graphs to support the visual representation of the analysis.
     ```plaintext
     Insert Tab > Chart > Create Charts
     ```

### 6. **Documenting the Analysis Process**
   - **Process Documentation**: Document each step of the analysis process, including data sources, methods used, parameters set, and any assumptions made.

     Example: Detail the buffer distances used, the criteria for suitability, and the network dataset parameters.
     ```

### 7. **Communicating the Results**
   - **Report Generation**: Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis results, including maps, charts, and interpretation of findings.
     ```plaintext
     Example: Explain the implications of the proximity analysis for transportation planning, or the suitability modeling for park development.
     ```
   - **Presentation**: Create a presentation to communicate the results to stakeholders, using visual aids such as slides, maps, and charts.
     ```plaintext
