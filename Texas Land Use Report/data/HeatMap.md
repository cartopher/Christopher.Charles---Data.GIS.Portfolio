# Python Script for Data Visualization and Analysis on Historical Precipitation Data

## Objective

The main objective is to perform data visualization and analysis on historical precipitation data. The script:

1. Imports Python modules for data manipulation and visualization.
2. Loads CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Cleans missing values.
4. Selects variables for analysis.
5. Groups data by “Year” and calculates means.
6. Generates a heatmap using seaborn.
7. Exports heatmap to PDF for sharing and reporting.

## Importing Libraries

Place import statements at the top, one per line.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
```

## Loading and Cleaning Data

Make this a function for easy source file changes.

```python
def load_and_clean_data(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.fillna(method="bfill", inplace=True)
    return df
```

## Subset Data

Modularize this for future expansions.

```python
def select_columns(df, columns):
    return df[columns]
```

## Data Aggregation

Make it generic to accept any column for grouping.

```python
def aggregate_data(df, group_by_col):
    return df.groupby([group_by_col]).mean().round(2)
```

## Visualization

Create a function for the heatmap.

```python
def generate_heatmap(df_grouped):
    with PdfPages('Bamberger_Precipitation_Heatmap.pdf') as pdf:
        # Heatmap configurations
        plt.show()
        pdf.savefig(fig)
        plt.close()
```

## Main Function

Tie everything together.

```python
def main():
    file_path = "/arcgis/home/bamberger_precip.csv"
    columns_to_select = ["Year", "Jan.", "Feb.", ..., "Annual Avg."]
    
    df = load_and_clean_data(file_path)
    df_selected = select_columns(df, columns_to_select)
    df_grouped = aggregate_data(df_selected, "Year")
    generate_heatmap(df_grouped)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Conclusion

Efficiently manages tasks from data cleaning to visualization. Highlight is the comprehensive heatmap for quick climate pattern understanding in the Bamberger region. Allows PDF export for easy sharing and analysis.

There you have it. This should make the information easier to navigate and understand. How do you usually go about documenting your code or projects?
